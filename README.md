# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

 The purpose of this analysis is to scrape data from the internet in order to create a web app that displays information and images of the planet, Mars.  Python3 was used to scrape the data and html code was used to customize then web app.

## Issues and Challenges

 The web scraping was tested using Jupiter notebook.  Once the output was acceptable, the file was converted into a .py python file to be used with MongoDB and Flask to set up the web app.  The code had to be modified form its original .ipynb Jupiter notebook format so that it would run smoothly in Python.  This required quite a bit of refactoring and research to make the hemisphere images display on the web app. The differences in code were slight but enough to make identifying the issue troublesome.

## Results

 The final web app produces the most recent Mars article, a table of Mars data compared to Earth data, an image featured of Mars, images of each hemisphere of Mars, and a button that will scrape new data.  The header image background color was changed to "sandy brown" to reflect the color of the Planet Mars. The button was updated to display a "Click me!" tooltip when the cursor hovers over the button.
